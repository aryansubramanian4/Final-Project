# Project Reflection - Aryan Subramanian & Vyome Poddar

## The Project

This project is a probability distribution calculator that outputs the probability values for different types of continuous and discrete distributions. The inspiration for this idea came from one of the classes offered at Babson, called Probabilities for Risk Management taught by Prof. Rick Cleary. It allows the user to input the parameters for their distribution and calculate all the different types of probability. This project will be presented to Prof Cleary, so that he could explore the website and potentially use it in the future throughout his classes, and even extend it to his students. 

## How it works

![Home Page of the Web Application](C:/Users/asubramanian4/Downloads/Home_Page.png)

The home page gives the user the choice of whether they want to choose a continuous distribution or discrete distribution.

Once the user has selected a specific distribution (for ex. Discrete), they now have the option of 4 specific discrete distributions.

Once a specific probability distribution has been chosen, the user can input the parameters specific to the distribution. In this case, they chose a Binomial Distribution with an x-value of 5, mean 8 and probability of 0.75.

Here, we see the output for the above binomial distribution. The output here displays the probability of x=5, x>5, and x<5, all within a few clicks, making it far more efficient that excel's calculation of these values. 

## Reflection and Evaluation

The overall project was very interesting to design and code and definitely used up our knowledge obtained througout class. It helped that we were interested in creating an application that was of interest and that it could potentially help a professor with their work and classes. 

The obvious changes we could make would be to incorporate more types of distributions to make this far more widely accessible than it currently is. Furthermore, the addition of the NLTK library would have been ideal, however due to external constraints this was made difficult.
